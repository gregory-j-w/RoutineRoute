# PROJECT 4

## Routine Route

Fourth project for WDI at General Assembly

##User Stories
  * User creates a profile and can add the routes they take every day - the
  bus to work, the L home - wherever they go on a regular basis. With their routes
  saved, they can easily see when their next bus or train will be at their stop.

## Planning
  Come soon....

## Technologies Used
  * Ruby on Rails
  * SCSS
  * Assembly
  * GIMP

## What is unfinished
  * The L routes are a work in progress. The 95th bound Red line is functional,
  but the remainder of the lines need to be coded into the program. The L API was
  easy to use, but routes, directions and stations need to be stored in a Database
  or hardcoded.
  * Mobile deployment


## What would you like to add
  * Email verification
  * Password change
  * User location / display routes in order of nearest to furthest from user's
  location.
